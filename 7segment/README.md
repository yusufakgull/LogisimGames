I  designed an FSM controller using Logisim program. This is a game implementation. In this game, you use 7 LEDs and two buttons for two players.
The game starts with the led in the middle turned on.
One user tries to shift the ON led to left while the other tries to push it to right.The one pushing the button faster wins the game. Winning occurs when the turned on led is at the rightmost or at the leftmost position.
I designed it by thinking of situations where both players press the keys at the same time or not at all. 
FSM controller has two button inputs as B1 and B2. It has 7 outputs one for each led. Also there will be a reset input to start a new game.
